   <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing channel. This includes methods like social media, email, video, blogs, chatbots, display ads, and more. While there's some value to traditional marketing like direct mail or billboards, more companies are investing in digital marketing for one simple reason â€” it works. Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels, platforms, and technologies to promote and advertise products, services, or brands to a target audience. It encompasses a wide range of online marketing activities and strategies that leverage the internet and electronic devices to connect with potential customers. Digital marketing has become increasingly important in the modern business landscape due to the widespread use of the internet and digital technologies.</p>
